## Pi in the Sky

### Planning

#### Idea 

Our basic idea is to make a drone with controlled flight. We will use four DC motors with propellers to control height, like a standard drone, but we will control the drone's horizontal movement with a fifth motor and propeller. We will use a wireless gamepad to increase and decrease the drone's altitude, rotate the directional motor, and change the speed of the directional motor.

#### Materials

Buy these motors? 5 for only 4 bucks, really light

Buy these propellers? Right shaft size and pretty cheap
